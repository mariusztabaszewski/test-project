I made 2 first tasks 'Implement views' and 'Make them responsive'.

I decided to code everything from scratch because I want to show my understanding of HTML and CSS.

I decided to code 'list of questions' and 'user profile' using floats.
'Single question view' was code using flexbox. I did this beacause I want to show that I understand each of this metod.

I code everything 'mobile first'.

I tried to keep my code clean and DRY.

I use Roboto font.

I use SASS and JADE.

I also use GRUNT.
